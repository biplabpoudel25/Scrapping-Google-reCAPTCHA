# Scrapping-Google-reCAPTCHA

This code helps to scrap google reCAPTCHA images from https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo. But, after certain number of images, google will detect the automated queries sent to it's page and will block us for more queries. So, you might need to check time and again to see if the corect images are being downloaded.
